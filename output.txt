Q.1
Three statements are given, followed by three conclusions numbered I, II and III. Assuming the statements to be true, even if
they seem to be at variance with commonly known facts, decide which of the conclusions logically follow(s) from the
statements.
Statements:
All pages are diaries.
Some diaries are books.
All books are notebooks.
Conclusions:
I. No page is a notebook.
II. All pages are notebooks.
III. All diaries being notebooks is a possibility.

3. Only conclusion III follows
4. Only conclusion II follows
Q.2
The position of how many letters will remain unchanged if all the letters in the word BINDER are arranged in English
alphabetical order?
Ans
1. None
2. One
3. Two
4. Three
Q.3
In a certain code language,
‘A + B’ means ‘A is the mother of B’;
‘A − B’ means ‘A is the brother of B’;
‘A × B’ means ‘A is the wife of B’ and
‘A ÷ B’ means ‘A is the father of B’.
Based on the above, how is 4 related to 2 if ‘4 + 3 ÷ 2 ÷ 1 − 5’?
Ans
1. Father’s father
2. Father’s mother
3. Mother’s father
